# DevOps NRW Homepage
Our meetup's little homepage. Please improve.

This is a static website, generated by the [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) application.

# Development
Fork or clone this repo. Then, use bundler to install the Ruby stuff:

```
[sudo] gem install bundler
bundle install
```
  
Middleman and all its requirements, as well as our additional gems, will be installed.

To view your local instance, a development webserver is included. Start it like this:

```
bundle exec middleman server
```
  
In the source directory, you can find the templates and asset files. Go ahead and edit them!

When you are happy with your changes, just push your commits and send us a pull request.

The website is automatically deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
